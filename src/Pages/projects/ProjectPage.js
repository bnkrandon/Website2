const problem = {
    "beakspeak" : "We have a lot of residential college pride, which is great because the residential college system does a good job of establishing a warm, welcoming community you come to call family! Unfortunately, this system tends to be socially divisive and at times suffocating. People don't feel encouraged to branch out to engage with the greater Rice society -- this leads to a lot of residential pride and very low Rice pride! Consumer research bears out the view that the residential college system is socially restrictive and that existing social outlets are good at maintaining existing relationships but not at forming new ones. Further, current social outlets carry the burden of identity. Therefore, the problem is that the current health of Rice pride and interconnectivy is poor, and improvement is desired.",
    "carpool" : "Currently, students use a Google Sheets document listing past and future carpool rides that contain the destination, date/time, studentâ€™s name, phone number, and other information. Students enter the time they plan to leave Rice or the airport, and if someone else matches with their time, they can contact each other and coordinate a ride. However, this does not have a smooth interface, does not have a way to show time flexibility, lacks security, and does not notify drivers of riders which have joined/left their carpool.",

    "hedwig" : "Currently, there is no effective way for Rice students to buy food from businesses at the Rice Memorial Center like East West Tea and the Hoot other than to travel there in person. Often, this prevents students that would have otherwise bought food from frequenting these establishments.",
